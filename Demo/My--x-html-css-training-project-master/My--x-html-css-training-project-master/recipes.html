        <h1>Wrox Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
        <p>I addapted this recipe from a book called <cite cite="htpp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0864119917/">
        Sydney Food</cite> by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on
        my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sidney, I
        have been afther the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I
        really believe are the <em>best</em> scrambled eggs I have ever
        tasted.</p>
        <p>This recipe is what I called a <q>very special breakfast</q>; just
        look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be
        believed.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of butter (10g)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of cream <i>(2 3/4 fl ounces)</i></li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>
            <li>3 fresh chives (chopped)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs, cream and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat <i>(taking 
            care not to burn the butter)</i></li>
            <li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until starts setting around 
            the edge of the pan (around 20 seconds).</li>
            <li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if
            it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>Fold the contents in again, leave for 20 secons and repeat until
            the eggs are only just done.</li>
            <li>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly milled pepper over the eggs
            and blend in some chopped fresh chives.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You should only make a <strong>maximun</strong> of two servings per
        frying pan.</p>
