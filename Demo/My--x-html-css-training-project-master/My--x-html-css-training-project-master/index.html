        <h2>This weekend's special bunch</h2>
        <p>This weekend, our season of special brunches continues with
        scrambled egg on an English muffin. Not for the faint-hearted, the
        secret to these eggs is that they are made with half cream and
        cooked in butter, with no more than four eggs in the pan at a
        time.</p>
